## Channel Names

A lab's Slack channels represent virtual rooms in which we can collaborate
on various topics. Our channel names should:

### Use all lowercase letters.

- :white_check_mark: `code` or `language-analysis`
- :no_entry_sign: `Code` or `Language-Analysis`

### Use hyphenated spaces.

- :white_check_mark: `language-analysis`
- :no_entry_sign: `language_analysis`

### Use descriptive phrases.

- :white_check_mark: `reinforcement-learning`
- :no_entry_sign: `rl`

### Use the minimum necessary words.

- :white_check_mark: `papers`
- :no_entry_sign: `papers-we-recommend`

### Use category prefixes for nested channel naming.

Nested channel naming is useful for designating teams to work on a specific
project or stage of project that has sibling channels, such as two different studies,
which are category `studies`, or five different analysis-focused channels, which are
`analysis`-categorized. Using prefixes like this has the additional benefit that 
channels will automatically sort by category in workspace navigation. 

- :white_check_mark: `studies_twitter-survey` or `analysis_emotion-amplification`
- :no_entry_sign: `twitter-survey-study` or `emotion-amplification_analysis`
