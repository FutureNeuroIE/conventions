# Conventions

Welcome to the Start Your Lab guide for _conventions_, a collection of
helpful guidelines to make teamwork more straightforward.
When members of a lab can agree to and follow conventions, they often find
working together on projects more fun, efficient, and effective.

Scientists are familiar with and use many conventions in their everyday work,
including citation style, significant figures, and confidence intervals. In the same
way, we hope to establish conventions for managing teams, projects, and code to facilitate
digital collaboration (e.g., within a lab), effective documentation, and open science.
