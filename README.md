# Conventions

**NOTE: Document in progress. Please make a feature request for things you 
would like to see here.**

Conventions are helpful practices that teams follow to write code together. There are
many types of conventions that a lab strives to adhere to, such as _naming conventions_
or _data management conventions_.

The **easiest** conventions are **naming** conventions. We agree to a pattern of naming
for any given topic of work we do because consistent, predictable names help us find
what we're looking for. Named entities that we share are everywhere: Slack channels, GitHub repositories,
Amazon S3 bucket names, RMarkdown file names, and so many more.
